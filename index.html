      const article = `A white veiled curtain hangs over the window. It billows inwards on a breeze that smells of grass longing for the lick of rain upon it. Ainsley is atop her bedsheets, cheek pressed into the crook of her arm. She’s leaning on a notebook, pen in hand. She likes this time of day. After sunset, but before the sky has completely darkened. She writes in the orange light of her bedside lamp; she writes everything she knows about love in hopes of figuring out what she’s missing and where to find it. Am I in love with him, or the idea of him? So much loneliness, she can hardly believe she had to bear it all alone.
~
On her way to breakfast, Ainsley meandered through Fitzroy Gardens. She’d seen a man and his bike laid down on the grass—he propped up on his elbow, the bike on its handlebars—helmet straps dangling around his chin as he dug a thumb into the skin of an orange. She imagined that when he took a bite, little droplets of juice would stick to his pornstache, and thought it quite sensual, that man and his bike and his orange. She took the path going towards Albert Street, passed that one fountain of the naked man, all mossy and donning a footy scarf, and crossed the road. The top of the café door was starting to lose colour where the bell rang against it. Her mother, Marie, looked up from a table on the far wall. Ainsley took the seat opposite her as a staff member brought two cappuccinos to the table. Her mother nodded a thank you to the waitress as Ainsley hung her bag over the back of her chair.
	‘Hope you don’t mind,’ Marie said. ‘Figured you’d want the usual,’
	‘Thanks mum,’
	‘And how’re things with Mabel? She didn’t want breakfast this morning?’ 
	Mabel was Ainsley’s housemate. Somewhat of a favourite. Never mind about me, Ainsley thought.  
	‘She’s doing alright for herself,’ Ainsley responded, brows raised, lips pursed.
	‘And that boy she’s been working with?’ 
	‘Snores,’
	‘Oh, you’re kidding! Lucky he’s good looking hey?’ Marie said.
	‘Sure is,’ 
	Ainsley took up a teaspoon, skimming it over the top of her cappuccino, raised a frothy spoonful to her mouth. She watched as her mother added a spoonful of sugar to her own cup, the granules sinking through the froth as if through a funnel. 
	‘So,’ Marie said, spoon circling. Ainsley squinted as the sun reflected off her mother’s engagement ring, a blind spot in her vision. ‘How’re things with you?’ 
	‘I’m getting by,’ Ainsley replied, fingers curled around her mug. 
	‘No one of interest?’ 
	Ainsley could name one.
	‘Nope,’
	‘Not even a little?’
	More than a little.
	‘Not even a little.’ 
	What was the use in having to explain her feelings when the one she had them for felt them for someone else. And what was the use of explaining said feelings when she struggled to even put a name to what they were exactly. It couldn’t be love; they say you know it when you feel it. 
~
Ainsley dressed in a linen skirt reaching down around her ankles, and top that sat asymmetrical over her shoulders. It was the type of top you couldn’t wear a bra with, so Ainsley didn’t. No one would notice, her chest was that flat—she just hoped it wouldn’t get cold. There was a reservation for the journalism company Ainsley worked for at a small restaurant in Fitzroy. Kris Kringle present in hand, she crossed the street to the corner where the restaurant was situated. She’d had to bunch her skirt up into her free hand, so not to limit her stride. She entered at midday and peered around for her co-workers. She felt a poke on her shoulder and turned to see Noah behind her. 
	‘Noah, you made it,’ she said, grinning. 
	‘Sure did,’ he replied, a skin creasing around his mouth as he returned the smile.
	Noah moved closer to Ainsley; one arm outstretched. She moved towards him, putting one arm over his shoulder and behind his neck, her face tilted so her chin could sit on his shoulder. She felt as his arm forearm came to rest over the stretch of her back, fingers almost reaching into her armpit as he held her. It was only for a moment. There were limits to these things—hugs with co-workers and men in long-term relationships. Ainsley suddenly felt self-conscious, wondering if he noticed the lack of breasts when he embraced her, in comparison to his girlfriend, Hannah. All that she had on her chest was simply metaphorical.
	‘Shall we?’ Noah asked, nodding in the direction of a table where their co-workers were finding seats.  
~
Robin was the type of guy you can never imagine unhappy. Nor could you imagine anyone feeling even a grain of disdain toward him. Unless, of course, you yourself were unhappy, and hated him a bit for his unending joy. He waltzed into the restaurant about ten minutes late, apologising profusely, placing a hand upon each person’s shoulder and giving them a perfunctory kiss on the cheek. He took a seat at the head of the table, adjacent to where Noah and Ainsley sat side by side. Opposite them sat Marjorie, whom Ainsley had been intimidated by when Marjorie had joined the company because she walked like she knew all the secrets of the universe. Ainsley got to know her over time, however, and found that really, she was humble, and just as clueless as Ainsley. Marjorie just had really good posture. 
	‘Did I miss much?’ Robin asked, a huff as he sat down. 
	‘No, not at all,’ Marjorie said. 
	‘Oh good,’ Robin responded. His hand seemed to reach for Marjorie’s knee beneath the table. ‘We’re still hitting the pub after this yeah?’
	‘How could we not?’ Noah responded.
	‘Can’t promise I’ll make it to dark though,’ Ainsley said, and felt Noah’s gaze on the side of her face. 
	‘You’ve gotta,’ he said.
	‘I’ll try my best,’ she replied, noticing his eyes settled on her lips as she spoke. ‘As long as I stop drinking all this champagne, I’ll be fine,’ 
	The staff had been topping up her glass every time it began to run low, which was often. Ainsley kept finding herself looking for something to busy her hands and mouth with when the conversation lulled. Her cheeks had grown pink, and pinker again as Noah gazed at her. 
	‘New year’s just around the corner,’ Ainsley said, dragging her attention away from him. She kicked herself for the sudden and boring turn of conversation. ‘I don’t know about you guys, but I’m glad to be done with this year,’
	‘Why’s that?’ Noah asked.
	‘Oh, just—’ 
	‘I have stopped getting excited about that kinda stuff,’ Robin said. Ainsley looked to Noah, who’s eyes met hers with acknowledgement of the interruption. ‘Nothing ever changes,’
~
Boarding a tram headed for Richmond, Ainsley found Noah’s pinkie brushing against her thumb as he reached for the same support she was holding onto. She looked at him, one brow slightly raised in question, fighting off a smile. 
 	‘Sorry,’ he said, shifting his hand to sit just a centimetre above hers. 
	Ainsley noticed how his fingers were long and thin, the tips bent and callused from playing guitar. She said nothing in response but moved her thumb to make brief contact with his finger once again. In retrospect, she did this for many reasons; to make him smile, and to ensure him the touch was nothing to worry about. She also supposed it could be seen as flirting, and that she could make up an excuse if it all were to backfire; if out of nowhere, Hannah were to appear, all curves and Personality. With a capital ‘p’ because apparently, it’s important and ‘looks don’t matter’. If that were true, Ainsley presumed she would be fighting off men left right and centre. 

	Ainsley, Noah, Marjorie, and Robin entered a pub that sat on the corner of two intersecting streets. Inside was buzzing with the energy of the end of the work year. Each table inside was already occupied, and so the four of them drifted to the outdoor area, squeezing between chairs and stools on their way. Ainsley had to fight the urge to latch onto Noah’s shirt sleeve so not to get lost in the crowd. It was a childish habit, really, but one that was difficult to shake off, remembering how easily all her other friends offered up a hand to hold while they weaved through dancing bodies at clubs or festivals. 
~
A two-dollar coin sank to the bottom of Robin’s beer, pin-prick pockets of air clinging to its golden surface. 
	‘Drink up Robin,’ Marjorie said, beaming. 
	The table grew rowdy with the chants of construction workers, who were all leaning in front of each other to make sure Robin got his drink down in one go.  Ainsley was in awe of the way Robin had asked if they could join the table, without a second guess, and how quickly the request had been met with ‘of course’ and ‘all yours’. It all seemed so much easier for men, who instantly befriend each other, as if they’d known each other all along. Women are too afraid of judgment from other women, and afraid of being seen as desperate by men. There was no approaching either without doubt. Robin finished off his beer. 
	‘So, Ainsley, any romance on the horizon?’ Marjorie asked. 
	Robin and Noah listened intently. Ainsley gazed around the table, trying not to let her eyes linger on Noah for even a second too long. 
	‘No, I don’t think so,’ she said with a shrug, looking to her hands, twisting the rings on her fingers. 
	‘None of them?’ Marjorie asked, tilting her head towards the other end of the table. 
	‘Nah,’ 
	‘Well, what exactly are you looking for then?’ Noah asked.
	‘Taller than me, by at least, like, three inches,’
	‘How tall’s that?’ Robin questioned.
	‘Six foot one. And no shorter,’ 
	‘Anything else?’ Noah again. 
	‘I don’t know. Nice to me, I guess. Funny?’
	‘You’ll never get anywhere being that picky,’ Robin said. 
	‘What? You think it’s too much to ask for someone to be nice to me?’ Ainsley asked, half-joking. 
	‘No, not that. Just tall and nice and funny,’ Robin said.
	‘I’m all those things,’ Ainsley responded. ‘And I think I’m allowed to be picky. Noah?’ she turned to face him, hopefully. 
	‘I’m sure the right person will come along,’ he said. 
	Ainsley thought he already had. 
~
‘Hey, Ainsley, we’re leaving. You coming?’ Noah asked from where he stood, a hand on the table as he bent towards her. 
At some point during the night, Ainsley had found herself wedged between two guys, who, up to standard, were both six foot one. They had promptly stood up to validate the fact, as if trying to catch the other out in lie. Ainsley had sat there in disbelief, finding Noah’s gaze across to table and finding an amused smirk on his face. She had her options; go with Noah and her friends or stay with these two strangers and perhaps develop enough of a liking towards one. But these strangers were competing in a competition that couldn’t be won. 
‘Yeh, give me a sec,’ she said. Then, addressing the men on either side of her; ‘I’m heading off,’ 
In a rather haphazard fashion, she typed her number into both of their phones, hugged them goodbye, and got up to leave. Noah was waiting, watching the interaction, whilst Robin and Marjorie had already gone through the door. She caught up to him quickly, grabbing his arm with both hands once they were out of sight. 
‘Did you see that?’ she asked.
‘Yeh,’ 
Ainsley released his arm as he led them through the tables to the front door. 
‘That has never happened to me before. They were practically fighting over me,’ 
‘Did you like either of them?’
‘Well, no. But that’s not the point,’
‘If you had to choose?’
‘Well, I guess Johnny. The one in the button up. The other guy was eh,’ 
‘Good man, Johnny,’
‘Yeh,’
Maybe if she could just let go of Noah, Ainsley thought, she would be happy with someone like Johnny. Maybe she wouldn’t waste such an opportunity; meeting someone organically in an age of dating apps and vanity. 
	‘Ready?’ Robin asked as they stepped out under the night sky, never so dark and starry as Ainsley remembered it being when she was younger. Ainsley nodded, and they began to walk through the streets of Richmond. She and Noah hung back; their steps unsteady, their forward movement slowed by the swaying of their path. Ainsley nudged Noah and motioned to Robin.
	‘Hey, look. Robin walks like—’ she stopped to stifle her laughter. ‘He walks like he needs orthotics but doesn’t wear them,’ 
Noah chuckled, and began to impersonate the way Robin’s arms swung, his short steps and the way he bounced on the soles of his feet as they slapped against the ground. It was mean, really. Ainsley dissolved into hysterics, reaching for a fence to grab onto. Instead, she found herself falling through an unlatched gate onto the front steps of someone’s home.  She’d never seen Noah look so alive as when he laughed, in that moment, the sky all around him. He came toward her, offering a hand, pulling her upright. They darted in the direction of Marjorie and Robin, who continued growing smaller as the distance stretched out. Noah slung an arm over Ainsley’s shoulders. 
	‘You’re such a lightweight,’ he said.
	‘You can hardly blame me,’
	‘Still, learn to walk straight,’ 
	Ainsley rolled her eyes, as they continued. It felt they’d been walking for hours, but they could keep on for eternity like this.
‘Tell me something,’ Ainsley said. 
	‘Like what?’
‘I don’t know, something about yourself. Something I don’t already know. Tell me something true,’ 
There were answers she wanted but didn’t know how to ask for. Did he really love Hannah? Was he only with her because it was comfortable and familiar? Didn’t he feel that he and Ainsley were two of the same? It could have been the two of them, alone, no Marjorie or Robin, and it would have made no difference; they would be just as happy. 
	‘I can’t think of anything you don’t already know about me,’ he replied. 
She wanted to ask what kept him up at night. What were his sources of worry? Did he ever doubt the path that he was on? She wanted him to tell her that he would never love her in the way she wanted. Or that he could and did, so that she would have that familiar feeling of fear, the urge to distance herself, and forget about the way his presence felt. Ainsley stopped walking, let Noah’s arm drop from her shoulder. He turned to face her, illuminated from the streetlight above him. 
	‘Are you happy?’ she asked. 
	‘What?’
	‘With your life? With Hannah?’ 
They were frozen there, Ainsley all but shaking, stomach churning, palms sweating, a pulse pounding across every inch of her body. 
	‘What are you saying?’ Noah said, expression unreadable. 
Ainsley couldn’t answer. She dropped her gaze, realising her inhalations were not enough, that there was not enough air, too dense with tension. 
	‘Forget about it,’ she managed, the effort of the words emptying the last of her breath from her. 
	‘Ainsley,’ Noah started. He stepped toward her, laid a hand upon her shoulder. She looked up at him, her eyes glazy, as if looking through a film. She hoped he didn’t notice. Stubble was growing on his top lip. ‘I do—’
	‘I think I should go,’ she blurted. She went to move away, barely able to stand still for a second longer. 
	‘Don’t,’ he said, grabbing Ainsley by the upper arm. 
	‘Why?’ she asked, stopping to face him. She didn’t know what she was asking.
	‘I do love you,’ Noah said, ‘But it’s not in the way you want. We’re friends. I hope it can stay that way,’ 
From the centre of her heart and mind, Ainsley swore she could feel a solidifying, molten rock to stone. 
	‘Yeh. I thought that might be the case,’ she said. ‘Just, don’t forget about me, okay?’ 
	‘Never,’
	‘Good,’ she said. Not a tear threatened to reach the waterline of her eyes. She didn’t feel the choke of emotion in her throat. Just the cool summer night air against her skin, and a deep fatigue. She was released from the unknowing. She could see now that all that time spent repressing her feelings was a waste. She’d finally freed herself from the weight anchoring her to the bottom of body of a lake. ‘It’s getting late anyway. I’ll see you around, Noah.’
	‘See you around,’ he said. 
She walked away, and he let her.
